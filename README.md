# Python-Project--Vancouver-Airbnb-Listings
This analysis was completed for the CareerFoundry advanced analytics assignment using open source data of our choice. The Python Jupyter Notebook files for the analysis are included.

## Objective
The purpose of this project was to conduct an exploratory visual analysis to investigate the impact of listing variables such as neighbourhood, room type, minimum night stays and more on the availability and reviews of Airbnb listings in Vancouver.

## Data
The data used for this project was sourced from Inside Airbnb. The website is not affiliated or sponsored by Airbnb - it is a website that generates data using public listing information from Airbnb's official website. The data can be accessed [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data). 

## Tools

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Sklearn and Quandl

Software: Jupyter Notebooks, Excel, Tableau

## Skills
1. Conducting exploratory analysis using correlation matrix heatmaps, pair plots, scatterplots, and categorical plots generated in Python
2. Data cleaning, wrangling, & subsetting - organizing data for analysis by finding missing values, duplicate values, dropping and renaming columns, etc.
3. Conducting geographical analysis in Python using geoJSON files
4. Exploring supervised machine learning techniques - running linear regression models on data and assessing model performance
5. Exploring unsupervised machine learning techniques - running kMeans cluster analysis models and assessing outcomes
6. Conducting time series analysis using data from Quandl

## Deliverables
